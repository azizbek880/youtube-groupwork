  <h1>What Motivates Us</h1>
  <h2>Our motivation behind this project and YouTube channel.</h2>
  <h3>We have created an imaginary business for a YouTube channel GOLAZOO which deals with the ever-so interesting world of football. The idea was fueled by our joint interest in football and its relevance across the globe. Football is something which unites people from different parts of the world and, hence, we thought of creating an elaborate informative platform that entertains and captivates especially younger audiences, educating them through innovative means. With GOLAZOO, we seek to provide informative video content on match highlights, player profiles, transfers, tactical analysis, and fan reactions. Our channel seeks not only to archive football videos but has a purpose: to break down football beyond its superficial aspects selecting various themes and presenting them in an analytical, engaging manner. So that it is focused around football, every member of the group was assigned different responsibilities – writing, editing the video, recording the voice, managing the social accounts and everything else which would lead to professional presentation.</h3>
  <h3>We’re motivated by the desire to produce high-quality, consistent content that speaks to fans' hearts and minds.
